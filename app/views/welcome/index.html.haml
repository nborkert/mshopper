%h2 Welcome!
%p 
  We provide a simple solution to a new problem: connecting electric vehicle (EV) owners with publicly available charging stations across the globe.
%b
  The planned launch of this site is early 2011.
%p 
  EV owners: Download our free "Charge Finder" app from the iPhone App Store to search for nearby EV charging stations. Additional methods of searching the directory are in development. 
  %a{:href => "/developers"} Developers
  are encouraged to use our resources to build and distribute innovative applications.
%p
EV charging station owners: Make your charging station known and available to iPhone "Charge Finder" users and other potential clients.
