<h1>Welcome Developers!</h1>
<p>
All developers are encouraged to query our database of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using our REST-based API.
<p>
A sample query follows the format of: http://mshopper.heroku.com/stations/?lat=40.37483328&lon=-75.11872690&format=json
<p>
The "lat" and "lon" parameters indicate the decimal latitude and longitude of the desired location. Query results of EV charging stations will be returned within a reasonable driving distance from the specified location. Decimal latitude and longitude coordinates of the EV charging stations are returned in the query results, enabling you to calculate driving distance, portray the stations on a map, or use as part of a separate application.
<p>
Supported output formats are XML and JSON. Specify the desired output format by setting the value of the "format" parameter to "xml" or "json" as desired. If you don't know what those formats are, back away from the keyboard and call in a developer.
